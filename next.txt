0. Code refactoring (styling, no magic vars, divide what is possible into functions and files, single responsability principle,)

1. Build the rest of obstacles by: 
-creating 3 aditional modals with different CV text in index.html
-create a function "obstacleCreator", pass this to it and do this.physics.add
-in that function create fields to each obstacle: a. id's of their respective modals
-modify doAtCollide to work with general obstacle

2. Populate modals with information

3. Point system in corner of camera

4. Welcome modal, among CV, explanation

5. When modal is open, game is paused

6. Add red ghost to follow player +: 
-when collide with player, kill animation from among us
-modal with game lost and restart button
-after 2nd attempt maybe add eliminate ghost btn

7. Further additions:
-scoreboard(time counted only when modals are closed) (choose name for that)
-total attempts
-add stop animation frame for player
-custom design of map, player, modals, etc.
-pause game button
-gamemode(easy: 1 ghost, hard: 10 ghosts, fog of war), shoot ghosts with bullets
-make it more playable (do little tasks like in original game to unlock CVmodals)
